#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, tools and methods to design, develop, test, deploy and maintain software products. 
Software Engnineering plays a role of enabling the creation of software applications and systems that easy day to day life in activities like health care, education, entertainment , communication and commerce.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Early challenges: In the 1960s, increasing software complexity led to project failures. This crisis prompted the formalization of software engineering as a disciplined field.
The 1970s marked the inception of structured software development. The Waterfall Model introduced a linear, phased approach to development, emphasizing planning and sequential progress. Simultaneously, structured programming focused on creating well-organized and maintainable code through modular design. These foundational concepts shaped the software development landscape.
Object-oriented programming: The 1970s and 80s saw the rise of object-oriented programming, improving code organization and reusability.
Agile development: The early 2000s brought Agile methodologies, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery and eased adaptability of software.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    - Create a requirements specification document
3. Design:
    - Develop a detailed design of the software architecture
    - Create user interface prototypes and mockups
    - Define data models and database schema
4. Implementation (Coding):
    - Write the software code
    - Develop and integrate individual components
    - Conduct unit testing and debugging
5. Testing:
    - Conduct various types of testing (integration, system, acceptance)
    - Identify and report defects
    - Perform test-driven development (TDD)
6. Deployment:
    - Release the software to production
    - Configure and install the software
    - Conduct post-deployment testing and monitoring
7. Maintenance:
    - Provide ongoing support and bug fixes
    - Perform updates and enhancements
    - Ensure continued alignment with changing requirements



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is suitable for projects with:
    - Well-defined requirements
    - Fixed timelines and budgets
    - Low risk of change
  scenario
  Developing an airport management system.
WHILE
  Agile is suitable for projects with:
    - Uncertain or changing requirements
    - Need for rapid prototyping and testing
    - High risk of changes
Scenario 
Developing a mobile app for a start up company that has not figured out the market needs yet
  Waterfall is more rigid, while Agile is more flexible.
  Waterfall has a clear separation of phases, while Agile has overlapping phases

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering refers to the process of phrasing text prompts or inputs to effectively interact with AI models to elicit specific, accurate, and relevant responses from the AI model.

Importance of prompt engineering:

Improved accuracy: Well-designed prompts help AI models understand the context and intent, leading to more accurate responses.
Increased relevance: Prompt engineering ensures the AI model's response is relevant to the user's query or task.
Enhanced user experience: Effective prompts lead to more natural and intuitive interactions with AI systems.
Better data quality: High-quality prompts result in better training data for AI models, improving their overall performance.
Efficient interaction: Prompt engineering minimizes the need for follow-up questions or clarifications, streamlining the interaction process.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Write something about artificial intelligence.

Write a concise, 2-paragraph summary of the current applications and limitations of artificial intelligence in healthcare, including at least one specific example.

Why the improved prompt is more effective:

1. Specificity: The improved prompt clearly states the topic (AI in healthcare) and scope (current applications and limitations).
2. Conciseness: The prompt requests a concise summary, indicating the desired length and format.
3. Clear requirements: The prompt specifies the inclusion of at least one specific example, ensuring the response provides concrete information.
4. Well-defined task: The prompt clearly defines the task, making it easier for the AI model to understand and generate a relevant response.
